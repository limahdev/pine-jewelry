This Pine Jewelry project was designed to practice using 2 photoshoot images and converting them into a single page website using using HTML and CSS. The task was to use images and specs based on detailed data to create the webpage for both mobile and desktop. Images recieved had to be resized/cropped based on photoshoot and a styles tile guide created based on the color palettes and fonts recieved. The webpage included a header with a navigation bar/hamburger menu, content with images and text, CTA's and buttons, and a built-out footer.  The webpage will be fully responsive with media queries that will be make the user experience great on all devices. Next steps will be to build the desktop version and add comments to the CSS code.
